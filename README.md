# Red-Blue-Project
TeamProject: Red-Blue Project

In this project, our team acted as security engineers supporting an organization's SOC infrastructure. A scenario was provided to us where SOC analysts have noticed some discrepancies with alerting in the Kibana system and the "manager" has asked our team to investigate and confirm that newly created alerts were working.
We were to monitor live traffic on the wire to detect any abnormalities that weren't reflected in the alerting system. Then, we reported back our findings with appropriate analysis.
